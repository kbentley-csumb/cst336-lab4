               <p>Here are some fun earth facts:
                   <ul>
                       <li>The earth is not a sphere. It is an oblate spherioid. It is mostly sphere shaped, but it is squished, and very bumpy.</li>
                       <li>The center of the earth is hot for several reasons, including radioactive elements decaying, and friction from elements moving within the earth's core due to gravity.</li>
                       <li>If you are reading this, you probably were born on the earth.</li>
                   </ul>
